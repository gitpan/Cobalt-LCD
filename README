Cobalt::LCD version 0.01
===============================

Cobalt::LCD is something I cooked up to make it easier to access the functionality available through my cobalt-panel-utils package.  It's mainly wrappers with extra code to make it a bit more usable and functional.  I haven't written any documentation yet, mostly because I'm lazy and trying to finish so many things at once.

If you have problems with this module, or even simply find it useful, feel free to send mail to the author, Jeff Walter, at jeffw@404ster.com .
